--This is a very basic java application, created for the counselling of GATE exam. First the number of student are given as input, thereafter, all the details of the students (name, marks) are to be entered with their preferences for different branches.

--The choice can be lock for each user, so that it cann't be changed again but by mistake it has been locked then the reset button can be used to change the details again.

-- After entering details of all the students, "counsel" button at the bottom of the window must be pressed, in order to save the details of the students in a file names filename.txt .


#BUG1
After entering the number of students, the window is not displayed automatically ( i think it is not able to focus on the window ), therefore I need to move the window to see the change(i.e. after entering number of students you have maximize the window to see the change).
